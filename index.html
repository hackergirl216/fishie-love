            <h2>Welcome Fishie Lovers &hearts; &amp; Humanoids</h2>
            <p>I am glad you have found your way to my I Love Fishies page. I can't wait to share my love for fishies with you. Hopefully after looking through this site you will also have a profound love for fishies and all things related to sea creatures.
                I have included a gallery of images of very cute fishies. I have an about page if you are interested in why I started this page in the first place. If you would like to contact me, feel free to reach out and express any questions of concerns
                about the entirety of this existence. I would prefer it to be related to fishies but existential questions are also welcome.</p>

            <h2>Some of My Nonsense...</h2>
            <p>Today, I took my dog, Mushu, on a walk. She is a land creature. Fishies are sea creatures. I love them both. Mushu is a big, fat, lard of a Bernese Mountain Dog. She used to have a collar. One time she slipped out of her collar on Euclid Ave.
                Euclid Ave is in downtown Cleveland. She ran across the street all the way back to John's apartment. She is a bitch. I love her all the same. She also eats lots of chicken wings. She now has a harness. It makes it easier to walk her. She
                walks further now, then she ever did before. She hates being on a leash. I don't blame her.</p>
            <p>I think a lot about what it would be like if I were a fishie. I could swim all day. I'd have the entire ocean to call my home. I would make a bunch of other fishie friends. It would be great. I would be warm all of the time and I also would
                be wet but wouldn't realize it. I could see a lot of cool reefs that boats aren't allowed to go near. I would meet some dolphins and befriend them. I would even befriend the sharks. They wouldn't eat me because they'd see how cool of a
                fishie friend I could be. They will be reasoned with. My entire mind could fir into a fishie. That would be wonderful. More wonderful than sushi. Sushi is terrible because it is dead fishies you are eating. I never ate sushi and I never
                will. If you eat sushi then you are going to hell.</p>

            <h2>Fisha&#771;</h2>
            <p>This is the correct spelling of fishie in the commonly used language of the sea creatures. Their language is called FO&#769; . Not many can speak the beautiful language of the sea. You cannot find it anywhere online. This is because FO&#769;
                is a highly secretive language gaurded by the most intelligent sea creatures. I am putting myself at great risk just by sharing the translation of fishie. Luckily, I have many friends within the community who gave me the go ahead to release
                this information. Thank you to them. They know who they are. </p>

I am a sad girl
Who likes fishies
I do not know
Where I'd be
Without
The cute aesthetic
Of fishies</p></pre>
